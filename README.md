# OdListings

  * This is basically a clone of the Elixir / Phoenix version of the [app](https://github.com/dvdhsu/od_listings).
  * This version was built in 1h and 30m (including pagination), just so I could show that I'm capable of building a app very quickly in a languge / framework that I'm familiar with (Ruby / Rails).
  * It supports filtering by bathrooms, bedrooms, and price, as well as pagination.
